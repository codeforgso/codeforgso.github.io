# codeforgso.github.io

This is a repo for the new CodeForGSO website.

## Previous site

The previous site can be viewed [here](https://codeforgso.github.io/codeforgreensboro.org) or [here](https://codeforgreensboro.org)

It has several problems. The biggest concern is that the website is not responsive and does not scale properly on mobile. Meaning phone users cannot easily interact with the site.  
The other major issue is the color scheme. Our current color scheme works well together but using red as a primary color is a little aggressive.

The website's copy is mostly okay but will require some updates.
