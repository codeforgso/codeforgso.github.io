      <h4>What We Do</h4>
        Code for Greensboro could not make it without the help of its community. Both tech-savy and none, we have had the opportunity to help others through the projects we conduct. The more, the merrier, as the level of impact we have is dependant on those who help. Join us on Slack and our meetups.
